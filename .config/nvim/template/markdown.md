**Tier:** Free, Premium, Ultimate
**Offering:** GitLab.com, GitLab Self-Managed, GitLab Dedicated

When you enter text in the GitLab UI, GitLab assumes the text is in the Markdown language.
The text is rendered with a set of styles. These styles are called *GitLab Flavored Markdown*.

You can use GitLab Flavored Markdown in the following areas:

- Comments
- Issues
- Epics
- Merge requests
- Milestones
- Snippets (the snippet must be named with a `.md` extension)
- Wiki pages
- Markdown documents inside repositories

You can also use other rich text files in GitLab. You might have to install a dependency
to do so. For more information, see the [`gitlab-markup` gem project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-markup).

NOTE:
As this Markdown specification is **valid for GitLab only**, you should
[view these styles as they appear on GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md).

We do our best to render the Markdown faithfully here, however the
[GitLab documentation website](https://docs.gitlab.com) and the [GitLab handbook](https://handbook.gitlab.com)
use a different Markdown processor.

## Differences with standard Markdown

<!--
Use this topic to list features that are not present in standard Markdown.
Don't repeat this information in each individual topic, unless there's a specific
reason, like in "Newlines".
-->

GitLab Flavored Markdown consists of the following:

- Core Markdown features, based on the [CommonMark specification](https://spec.commonmark.org/current/).
- Extensions from [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).
- Extensions made specifically for GitLab.

All standard Markdown formatting should work as expected in GitLab. Some standard
functionality is extended with additional features, without affecting the standard usage.

The following features are not found in standard Markdown:

- [Color chips written in `HEX`, `RGB` or `HSL`](#colors)
- [Description lists](#description-lists)
- [Diagrams and flowcharts](#diagrams-and-flowcharts)
- [Emoji](#emoji)
- [Footnotes](#footnotes)
- [Front matter](#front-matter)
- [GitLab-specific references](#gitlab-specific-references)
- [Includes](#includes)
- [Inline diffs](#inline-diff)
- [Math equations and symbols written in LaTeX](#math-equations)
- [Strikethrough](#emphasis)
- [Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)
- [Tables](#tables)
- [Task lists](#task-lists)
- [Wiki-specific Markdown](#wiki-specific-markdown)

The following features are extended from standard Markdown:

| Standard Markdown                     | Extended Markdown in GitLab |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| [Blockquotes](#blockquotes)           | [Multiline blockquotes](#multiline-blockquote) |
| [Code blocks](#code-spans-and-blocks) | [Colored code and syntax highlighting](#syntax-highlighting) |
| [Headings](#headings)                 | [Linkable heading IDs](#heading-ids-and-links) |
| [Images](#images)                     | [Embedded videos](#videos) and [audio](#audio) |
| [Links](#links)                       | [Automatically linking URLs](#url-auto-linking) |

## Markdown and accessibility

When you use GitLab Flavored Markdown, you are creating digital content.
This content should be as accessible as possible to your audience.
The following list is not exhaustive, but it provides guidance for some of the GitLab Flavored Markdown styles to pay
particular attention to:

### Accessible headings

Use heading formatting to create a logical heading structure.
The structure of headings on a page should make sense, like a good table of contents.
Ensure that there is only one `h1` element on a page, that heading levels are not skipped, and that they are nested correctly.

### Accessible tables

To keep tables accessible and scannable, tables should not have any empty cells.
If there is no otherwise meaningful value for a cell, consider entering **N/A** for "not applicable" or **None**.

### Accessible images and videos

Describe the image or video in the `[alt text]`. Make the description accurate, succinct, and unique.
Don't use `image of` or `video of` in the description. For more information, see [WebAim Alternative Text](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/).

## Headings

Create headings from 1 to 6 by using `#`.

```markdown
# H1
## H2
### H3
#### H4
##### H5
###### H6
```

Alternatively, for H1 and H2, use an underline style:

```markdown
Alt-H1
======

Alt-H2
------
```

### Heading IDs and links

> - Heading link generation [changed](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/440733) in GitLab 17.0.

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#heading-ids-and-links).

All Markdown-rendered headings automatically
get IDs that can be linked to, except in comments.

On hover, a link to those IDs becomes visible to make it easier to copy the link to
the heading to use it somewhere else.

The IDs are generated from the content of the heading according to the following rules:

1. All text is converted to lowercase.
1. All non-word text (such as punctuation or HTML) is removed.
1. All spaces are converted to hyphens.
1. Two or more hyphens in a row are converted to one.
1. If a heading with the same ID has already been generated, a unique
   incrementing number is appended, starting at 1.

Example:

```markdown
# This heading has spaces in it
## This heading has a :thumbsup: in it
# This heading has Unicode in it: 한글
## This heading has spaces in it
### This heading has spaces in it
## This heading has 3.5 in it (and parentheses)
## This heading has  multiple spaces and --- hyphens
```

Would generate the following link IDs:

1. `this-heading-has-spaces-in-it`
1. `this-heading-has-a-thumbsup-in-it`
1. `this-heading-has-unicode-in-it-한글`
1. `this-heading-has-spaces-in-it-1`
1. `this-heading-has-spaces-in-it-2`
1. `this-heading-has-35-in-it-and-parentheses`
1. `this-heading-has--multiple-spaces-and-----hyphens`

## Line breaks

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#line-breaks).

A line break is inserted (a new paragraph starts) if the previous text is
ended with two newlines. For example, when you press <kbd>Enter</kbd> twice in a row. If you only
use one newline (press <kbd>Enter</kbd> once), the next sentence remains part of the
same paragraph. Use this approach if you want to keep long lines from wrapping, and keep
them editable:

```markdown
Here's a line for us to start with.

This longer line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it is a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
These lines are only separated by single newlines,
so they *do not break* and just follow the previous lines
in the *same paragraph*.
```

Here's a line for us to start with.

This longer line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it is a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...
These lines are only separated by single newlines,
so they *do not break* and just follow the previous lines
in the *same paragraph*.

### Newlines

GitLab Flavored Markdown adheres to the Markdown specification for handling
[paragraphs and line breaks](https://spec.commonmark.org/current/).

A paragraph is one or more consecutive lines of text, separated by one or
more blank lines (two newlines at the end of the first paragraph), as [explained above](#line-breaks).

Need more control over line breaks or soft returns? Add a single line break
by ending a line with a backslash, or two or more spaces. Two newlines in a row create a new
paragraph, with a blank line in between:

```markdown
First paragraph.
Another line in the same paragraph.
A third line in the same paragraph, but this time ending with two spaces.<space><space>
A new line directly under the first paragraph.

Second paragraph.
Another line, this time ending with a backslash.\
A new line due to the previous backslash.
```

## Emphasis

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#emphasis).

You can emphasize text in multiple ways. Use italics, bold, strikethrough,
or combine these emphasis styles together.

Examples:

```markdown
Emphasis, or italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, or bold, with double **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough with double tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~
```

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD050 -->

Emphasis, or italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, or bold, with double **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

Strikethrough with double tildes. ~~Scratch this.~~

<!-- markdownlint-enable MD050 -->

### Mid-word emphasis

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#multiple-underscores-in-words).

Avoid italicizing a portion of a word, especially when you're
dealing with code and names that often appear with multiple underscores.

GitLab Flavored Markdown ignores multiple underlines in words,
to allow better rendering of Markdown documents discussing code:

```markdown
perform_complicated_task

do_this_and_do_that_and_another_thing

but_emphasis is_desired _here_
```

<!-- vale gitlab_base.Spelling = NO -->

perform_complicated_task

do_this_and_do_that_and_another_thing

but_emphasis is_desired _here_

<!-- vale gitlab_base.Spelling = YES -->

---

If you wish to emphasize only a part of a word, it can still be done with asterisks:

```markdown
perform*complicated*task

do*this*and*do*that*and*another thing
```

perform*complicated*task

do*this*and*do*that*and*another thing

### Inline diff

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#inline-diff).

With inline diff tags, you can display `{+ additions +}` or `[- deletions -]`.

The wrapping tags can be either curly braces or square brackets:

```markdown
- {+ addition 1 +}
- [+ addition 2 +]
- {- deletion 3 -}
- [- deletion 4 -]
```

![Inline diff as rendered by the GitLab interface](img/inline_diff_01_v13_3.png)

---

However, you cannot mix the wrapping tags:

```markdown
- {+ addition +]
- [+ addition +}
- {- deletion -]
- [- deletion -}
```

Diff highlighting doesn't work with `` `inline code` ``. If your text includes backticks (`` ` ``), [escape](#escape-characters)
each backtick with a backslash <code>&#92;</code>:

```markdown
- {+ Just regular text +}
- {+ Text with `backticks` inside +}
- {+ Text with escaped \`backticks\` inside +}
```

![Inline diff with mixed formatting, as rendered by the GitLab interface](img/inline_diff_02_v13_3.png)

### Horizontal rule

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#horizontal-rule).

Create a horizontal rule by using three or more hyphens, asterisks, or underscores:

```markdown
---

***

___
```

---

---

---

## Lists

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#lists).

You can create ordered and unordered lists.

For an ordered list, add the number you want the list
to start with, like `1.`, followed by a space, at the start of each line.
After the first number, it does not matter what number you use. Ordered lists are
numbered automatically by vertical order, so repeating `1.` for all items in the
same list is common. If you start with a number other than `1.`, it uses that as the first
number, and counts up from there.

Examples:

```markdown
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
   - Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
   1. Ordered sub-list
   1. Next ordered sub-list item
4. And another item.
```

<!--
The "2." and "4." in the example above are changed to "1." below, to match the style
standards on docs.gitlab.com.
See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide/index.html#lists
-->

1. First ordered list item
1. Another item
   - Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
   1. Ordered sub-list
   1. Next ordered sub-list item
1. And another item.

For an unordered list, add a `-`, `*` or `+`, followed by a space, at the start of
each line. Don't mix the characters in the same list.

```markdown
Unordered lists can:

- use
- minuses

They can also:

* use
* asterisks

They can even:

+ use
+ pluses
```

<!--
The "*" and "+" in the example above are changed to "-" below, to match the style
standards on docs.gitlab.com.
See https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide/index.html#lists
-->

Unordered lists can:

- use
- minuses

They can also:

- use
- asterisks

They can even:

- use
- pluses

---

If a list item contains multiple paragraphs, each subsequent paragraph should be indented
to the same level as the start of the list item text.

Example:

```markdown
1. First ordered list item

   Second paragraph of first item.

1. Another item
```

1. First ordered list item

   Second paragraph of first item.

1. Another item

---

If the first item's paragraph isn't indented with the proper number of spaces,
the paragraph appears outside the list.
Use the correct number of spaces to properly indent under the list item.
For example:

```markdown
1. First ordered list item

  (Paragraph of first item.)

1. Another item
```

1. First ordered list item

  (Paragraph of first item.)

1. Another item

---

Ordered lists that are the first sub-item of an unordered list item must have a preceding blank line if they don't start with `1.`.

**Good**

```markdown
- Unordered list item

  5. First ordered list item
```

**Bad**

```markdown
- Unordered list item
  5. First ordered list item
```

---

CommonMark ignores blank lines between ordered and unordered list items, and considers them part of a single list. The items are rendered as a
_[loose](https://spec.commonmark.org/0.30/#loose)_ list. Each list item is enclosed in a paragraph tag and therefore has paragraph spacing and margins.
This makes the list look like there is extra spacing between each item.

For example:

```markdown
- First list item
- Second list item

- A different list
```

CommonMark ignores the blank line and renders this as one list with paragraph spacing.

### Description lists

> - Description lists [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/26314) in GitLab 17.7.

A description list is a list of terms with corresponding descriptions.
Each term can have multiple descriptions.
In HTML this is represented with `<dl>`, `<dt>`, and `<dd>` tags.

To create a description list, place the term on one line, with the description on the next line beginning with a colon.

```markdown
Fruits
: apple
: orange

Vegetables
: broccoli
: kale
: spinach
```

You can also have a blank line between the term and description.

```markdown
Fruits

: apple

: orange
```

### Task lists

> - Inapplicable checkboxes [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/85982) in GitLab 15.3.

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#task-lists).

You can add task lists anywhere Markdown is supported.

- In issues, merge requests, epics, and comments, you can select the boxes.
- In all other places, you cannot select the boxes. You must edit the Markdown manually
  by adding or removing an `x` in the brackets.

Besides complete and incomplete, tasks can also be **inapplicable**. Selecting an inapplicable checkbox
in an issue, merge request, epic, or comment has no effect.

To create a task list, follow the format of an ordered or unordered list:

```markdown
- [x] Completed task
- [~] Inapplicable task
- [ ] Incomplete task
  - [x] Sub-task 1
  - [~] Sub-task 2
  - [ ] Sub-task 3

1. [x] Completed task
1. [~] Inapplicable task
1. [ ] Incomplete task
   1. [x] Sub-task 1
   1. [~] Sub-task 2
   1. [ ] Sub-task 3
```

![Task list as rendered by GitLab](img/completed_tasks_v15_3.png)

To include task lists in tables, [use HTML list tags or HTML tables](#task-lists-in-tables).

## Links

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#links).

You can create links two ways: inline-style and reference-style. For example:

<!--
The following codeblock uses HTML to skip the Vale ReferenceLinks test.
Do not change it back to a markdown codeblock.
-->

<pre class="highlight"><code>- This line shows an [inline-style link](https://www.google.com)
- This line shows a [link to a repository file in the same directory](permissions.md)
- This line shows a [relative link to a file one directory higher](../index.md)
- This line shows a [link that also has title text](https://www.google.com "This link takes you to Google!")

Using heading ID anchors:

- This line links to [a section on a different Markdown page, using a "#" and the heading ID](permissions.md#project-features-permissions)
- This line links to [a different section on the same page, using a "#" and the heading ID](#heading-ids-and-links)

Using references:

- This line shows a [reference-style link, see below][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]
- You can [use numbers for reference-style link definitions, see below][1]
- Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself][], see below.

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

&#91;arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/
&#91;1]: https://slashdot.org
&#91;link text itself]: https://about.gitlab.com/
</code></pre>

- This line shows an [inline-style link](https://www.google.com)
- This line shows a [link to a repository file in the same directory](permissions.md)
- This line shows a [relative link to a file one directory higher](../index.md)
- This line shows a [link that also has title text](https://www.google.com "This link takes you to Google!")

Using heading ID anchors:

- This line links to [a section on a different Markdown page, using a "#" and the heading ID](permissions.md#project-members-permissions)
- This line links to [a different section on the same page, using a "#" and the heading ID](#heading-ids-and-links)

Using references:

<!--
The example below uses in-line links to pass the Vale ReferenceLinks test.
Do not change to reference style links.
-->

- This line is a [reference-style link, see below](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/)
- You can [use numbers for reference-style link definitions, see below](https://slashdot.org)
- Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself](https://about.gitlab.com/), see below.

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

NOTE:
Relative links do not allow the referencing of project files in a wiki
page, or a wiki page in a project file. The reason: a wiki is always
in a separate Git repository in GitLab. For example, `[I'm a reference-style link](style)`
points the link to `wikis/style` only when the link is inside of a wiki Markdown file.

### URL auto-linking

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#url-auto-linking).

Almost any URL you put into your text is auto-linked:

```markdown
- https://www.google.com
- https://www.google.com
- ftp://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/
- smb://foo/bar/baz
- irc://irc.freenode.net/
- http://localhost:3000
```

- <https://www.google.com>
- <https://www.google.com>
- <ftp://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/>
- <a href="smb://foo/bar/baz/">smb://foo/bar/baz</a>
- <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net">irc://irc.freenode.net</a>
- <http://localhost:3000>

## GitLab-specific references

> - Autocomplete for wiki pages [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/442229) in GitLab 16.11.
> - Ability to reference labels from groups [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/455120) in GitLab 17.1.

GitLab Flavored Markdown renders GitLab-specific references. For example, you can reference
an issue, a commit, a team member, or even an entire project team. GitLab Flavored Markdown turns
that reference into a link so you can navigate between them. All references to projects should use the
**project slug** rather than the project name.

Additionally, GitLab Flavored Markdown recognizes certain cross-project references and also has a shorthand
version to reference other projects from the same namespace.

GitLab Flavored Markdown recognizes the following:

<!-- When epics as work items are generally available and feature flag `work_item_epics` is removed,
update the Epic entry to use only the `#` symbol. -->

| References                                                                           | Input                                                 | Cross-project reference                        | Shortcut inside the same namespace |

**Footnotes:**

1. [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/384885) in GitLab 16.9.
   Iteration cadence references are always rendered following the format `[cadence:<ID>]`.
   For example, the text reference `[cadence:"plan"]` renders as `[cadence:1]` if the referenced
   iterations cadence's ID is `1`.
1. For labels or milestones, prepend a `/` before `namespace/project` to specify the exact label
   or milestone, removing any possible ambiguity.

For example, referencing an issue by using `#123` formats the output as a link
to issue number 123 with text `#123`. Likewise, a link to issue number 123 is
recognized and formatted with text `#123`. If you don't want `#123` to link to an issue,
add a leading backslash `\#123`.

In addition to this, links to some objects are also recognized and formatted.
For example:

- Comments on issues: `"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/1234#note_101075757"`, rendered as `#1234 (comment 101075757)`
- The issues designs tab: `"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/1234/designs"`, rendered as `#1234 (designs)`.
- Links to individual designs: `"https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/1234/designs/layout.png"`, rendered as `#1234[layout.png]`.

### Show item title

> - Support for work items (tasks, objectives, and key results) [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/390854) in GitLab 16.0.

To include the title in the rendered link of an issue, task, objective, key result, merge request, or epic:

- Add a plus (`+`) at the end of the reference.

For example, a reference like `#123+` is rendered as `The issue title (#123)`.

URL references like `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/1234+` are also expanded.

### Show item summary

> - Support for issues and merge requests [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/386937) in GitLab 15.10.
> - Support for work items (tasks, objectives, and key results) [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/390854) in GitLab 16.0.

To include an extended summary in the rendered link of an issue, task, objective, key result, or merge request:

- Add a `+s` at the end of the reference.

Summary includes information about **assignees**, **milestone** and **health status** of referenced item.

For example, a reference like `#123+s` is rendered as
`The issue title (#123) • First Assignee, Second Assignee+ • v15.10 • Needs attention`.

URL references like `https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/1234+s` are also expanded.

To update the rendered references if the assignee, milestone, or health status changed:

- Edit the comment or description and save it.

Issue [420807](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/420807) tracks improving how these
references refresh.

### Comment preview on hover

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/29663) in GitLab 17.3 [with a flag](../administration/feature_flags.md) named `comment_tooltips`. Disabled by default.
> - Feature flag removed in GitLab 17.6

Hovering over a link to a comment shows the author and first line of the comment.

### Embed Observability dashboards

You can embed GitLab Observability UI dashboards descriptions and comments, for example in epics, issues, and MRs.

To embed an Observability dashboard URL:

1. In GitLab Observability UI, copy the URL in the address bar.
1. Paste your link in a comment or description. GitLab Flavored Markdown recognizes the URL and displays the source.

## Tables

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#tables-1).

When creating tables:

- The first line contains the headers, separated by pipe characters (`|`).
- The second line separates the headers from the cells.
  - The cells can contain only empty spaces, hyphens, and (optionally) colons for horizontal alignment.
  - Each cell must contain at least one hyphen, but adding more hyphens to a cell does not change the cell's rendering.
  - Any content other than hyphens, whitespace, or colons is not allowed
- The third, and any following lines, contain the cell values.
  - You **can't** have cells separated over many lines in the Markdown, they must be kept to single lines, but they can be very long. You can also include HTML `<br>` tags to force newlines if needed.
  - The cell sizes **don't** have to match each other. They are flexible, but must be separated by pipes (`|`).
  - You **can** have blank cells.
- Column widths are calculated dynamically based on the content of the cells.
- To use the pipe character (`|`) in the text and not as table delimiter, you must [escape](#escape-characters) it with a backslash (`\|`).

Example:

```markdown
| header 1 | header 2 | header 3 |
| ---      | ---      | ---      |
| cell 1   | cell 2   | cell 3   |
| cell 4 | cell 5 is longer | cell 6 is much longer than the others, but that's ok. It eventually wraps the text when the cell is too large for the display size. |
| cell 7   |          | cell 9   |
```

| header 1 | header 2 | header 3 |
| ---      | ---      | ---      |
| cell 1   | cell 2   | cell 3   |
| cell 4 | cell 5 is longer | cell 6 is much longer than the others, but that's ok. It eventually wraps the text when the cell is too large for the display size. |
| cell 7   |          | cell 9   |

### Alignment

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#alignment).

Additionally, you can choose the alignment of text in columns by adding colons (`:`)
to the sides of the "dash" lines in the second row. This affects every cell in the column:

```markdown
| Left Aligned | Centered | Right Aligned |
| :---         | :---:    | ---:          |
| Cell 1       | Cell 2   | Cell 3        |
| Cell 4       | Cell 5   | Cell 6        |
```

| Left Aligned | Centered | Right Aligned |
| :---         | :---:    | ---:          |
| Cell 1       | Cell 2   | Cell 3        |
| Cell 4       | Cell 5   | Cell 6        |

[In GitLab itself](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#tables),
the headers are always left-aligned in Chrome and Firefox, and centered in Safari.

### Cells with multiple lines

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#cells-with-multiple-lines).

You can use HTML formatting to adjust the rendering of tables. For example, you can
use `<br>` tags to force a cell to have multiple lines:

```markdown
| Name | Details |
| ---  | ---     |
| Item1 | This text is on one line |
| Item2 | This item has:<br>- Multiple items<br>- That we want listed separately |
```

| Name | Details |
| ---  | ---     |
| Item1 | This text is on one line |
| Item2 | This item has:<br>- Multiple items<br>- That we want listed separately |

### Task lists in tables

To add [task lists](#task-lists) with checkboxes, use HTML formatting. Using either:

- **An HTML table with Markdown in the cells.** Tables formatted this way result in fully functioning
  task lists.

  ```html
  <table>
  <thead>
  <tr><th>header 1</th><th>header 2</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
  <td>cell 1</td>
  <td>cell 2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>cell 3</td>
  <td>

  - [ ] Task one
  - [ ] Task two

  </td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>
  ```

- **A Markdown table with HTML list tags.** These tasks don't save their state when selected.
  Tables formatted this way do not render properly on `docs.gitlab.com`.

  ```markdown
  | header 1 | header 2 |
  | ---      | ---      |
  | cell 1   | cell 2   |
  | cell 3   | <ul><li> - [ ] Task one </li><li> - [ ] Task two </li></ul> |
  ```

You can also [create a table in the rich text editor](rich_text_editor.md#tables) and insert a task list then.

### Copy and paste from a spreadsheet

If you're working in spreadsheet software (for example, Microsoft Excel, Google
Sheets, or Apple Numbers), GitLab creates a Markdown table when you copy and paste
from a spreadsheet. For example, suppose you have the
following spreadsheet:

![Copy from spreadsheet](img/markdown_copy_from_spreadsheet_v12_7.png)

Select the cells and copy them to your clipboard. Open a GitLab Markdown
entry and paste the spreadsheet:

![Paste to Markdown table](img/markdown_paste_table_v12_7.png)

### JSON tables

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/merge_requests/86353) in GitLab 15.3.
> - Ability to use Markdown [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/375177) in GitLab 17.9.

To render tables with JSON code blocks, use the following syntax:

````markdown
```json:table
{}
```
````

Watch the following video walkthrough of this feature:

<div class="video-fallback">
  See the video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=12yWKw1AdKY">Demo: JSON Tables in Markdown</a>.
</div>
<figure class="video-container">
  <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/12yWKw1AdKY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen> </iframe>
</figure>

The `items` attribute is a list of objects representing the data points.

````markdown
```json:table
{
    "items" : [
      {"a": "11", "b": "22", "c": "33"}
    ]
}
```
````

To specify the table labels, use the `fields` attribute.

````markdown
```json:table
{
    "fields" : ["a", "b", "c"],
    "items" : [
      {"a": "11", "b": "22", "c": "33"}
    ]
}
```
````

Not all elements of `items` must have corresponding values in `fields`.

````markdown
```json:table
{
    "fields" : ["a", "b", "c"],
    "items" : [
      {"a": "11", "b": "22", "c": "33"},
      {"a": "211", "c": "233"}
    ]
}
```
````

When `fields` is not explicitly specified, the labels are picked from the first element of `items`.

````markdown
```json:table
{
    "items" : [
      {"a": "11", "b": "22", "c": "33"},
      {"a": "211", "c": "233"}
    ]
}
```
````

You can specify custom labels for `fields`.

````markdown
```json:table
{
    "fields" : [
        {"key": "a", "label": "AA"},
        {"key": "b", "label": "BB"},
        {"key": "c", "label": "CC"}
    ],
    "items" : [
      {"a": "11", "b": "22", "c": "33"},
      {"a": "211", "b": "222", "c": "233"}
    ]
}
```
````

You can enable sorting for individual elements of `fields`.

````markdown
```json:table
{
    "fields" : [
        {"key": "a", "label": "AA", "sortable": true},
        {"key": "b", "label": "BB"},
        {"key": "c", "label": "CC"}
    ],
    "items" : [
      {"a": "11", "b": "22", "c": "33"},
      {"a": "211", "b": "222", "c": "233"}
    ]
}
```
````

You can use the `filter` attribute to render a table with content filtered dynamically by user input.

````markdown
```json:table
{
    "fields" : [
        {"key": "a", "label": "AA"},
        {"key": "b", "label": "BB"},
        {"key": "c", "label": "CC"}
    ],
    "items" : [
      {"a": "11", "b": "22", "c": "33"},
      {"a": "211", "b": "222", "c": "233"}
    ],
    "filter" : true
}
```
````

You can use the `markdown` attribute to allow for GitLab Flavored Markdown in the items and caption,
including GitLab references. Fields do not support Markdown.

````markdown
```json:table
{
    "fields" : [
        {"key": "a", "label": "AA"},
        {"key": "b", "label": "BB"},
        {"key": "c", "label": "CC"}
    ],
    "items" : [
      {"a": "11", "b": "**22**", "c": "33"},
      {"a": "#1", "b": "222", "c": "233"}
    ],
    "markdown" : true
}
```
````

By default, every JSON table has the caption `Generated with JSON data`.
You can override this caption by specifying the `caption` attribute.

````markdown
```json:table
{
    "items" : [
      {"a": "11", "b": "22", "c": "33"}
    ],
    "caption" : "Custom caption"
}
```
````

If JSON is invalid, an error occurs.

````markdown
```json:table
{
    "items" : [
      {"a": "11", "b": "22", "c": "33"}
    ],
}
```
````

## Multimedia

Embed images, videos, and audio.
You can add multimedia using Markdown syntax to link files, set dimensions, and display them inline.
Formatting options let you customize titles, specify width and height, and control how media appears
in the rendered output.

### Images

### Videos

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#videos).

Image tags that link to files with a video extension are automatically converted to
a video player. The valid video extensions are `.mp4`, `.m4v`, `.mov`, `.webm`, and `.ogv`:

Here's an example video:

```markdown
![Sample Video](img/markdown_video.mp4)
```

![Sample Video](img/markdown_video.mp4)

### Change image or video dimensions

> - Support for images [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/28118) in GitLab 15.7.
> - Support for videos [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/17139) in GitLab 15.9.

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#change-the-image-or-video-dimensions).

You can control the width and height of an image or video by following the image with
an attribute list.
The value must an integer with a unit of either `px` (default) or `%`.

For example

```markdown
![alt text](img/markdown_logo.png "Title Text"){width=100 height=100px}

![alt text](img/markdown_logo.png "Title Text"){width=75%}
```

![alt text](img/markdown_logo.png "Title Text"){width=100 height=100px}

You can also use the `img` HTML tag instead of Markdown and set its `height` and
`width` parameters.

When you paste a higher resolution PNG image into a Markdown text box [in GitLab 17.1 and later](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/419913),
dimensions are always appended. The dimensions are automatically adjusted to
accommodate for retina (and other higher-resolution) displays. For instance,
a 144ppi image is resized to 50% of its dimensions, whereas a 96ppi image is
resized to 75% of its dimensions.

### Audio

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#audio).

Similar to videos, link tags for files with an audio extension are automatically converted to
an audio player. The valid audio extensions are `.mp3`, `.oga`, `.ogg`, `.spx`, and `.wav`:

Here's an example audio clip:

```markdown
![Sample Audio](img/markdown_audio.mp3)
```

![Sample Audio](img/markdown_audio.mp3)

## Blockquotes

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#blockquotes).

Use a blockquote to highlight information, such as a side note. It's generated
by starting the lines of the blockquote with `>`:

```markdown
> Blockquotes help you emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This very long line is still quoted properly when it wraps. Keep writing to make sure this line is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. You can also *use* **Markdown** in a blockquote.
```

> Blockquotes help you emulate reply text.
> This line is part of the same quote.

Quote break.

> This very long line is still quoted properly when it wraps. Keep writing to make sure this line is long enough to actually wrap for everyone. You can also *use* **Markdown** in a blockquote.

### Multiline blockquote

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#multiline-blockquote).

Create multi-line blockquotes fenced by `>>>`:

```markdown
>>>
If you paste a message from somewhere else

that spans multiple lines,

you can quote that without having to manually prepend `>` to every line!
>>>
```

## Code spans and blocks

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#code-spans-and-blocks).

Highlight anything that should be viewed as code and not standard text.

Inline code is formatted with single backticks `` ` ``:

```markdown
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.
```

Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

---

To achieve a similar effect for a larger code example, you can:

- Fence an entire block of code with triple backticks (```` ``` ````).
  - You can use more than three backticks, as long as both the opening and closing set have the same number.
    When you create a [multi-line suggestion](project/merge_requests/reviews/suggestions.md)
    containing a code block, the number of backticks automatically increases.
- Fence an entire block of code with triple tildes (`~~~`).
- Indent it four or more spaces.

````markdown
```python
def function():
    #indenting works just fine in the fenced code block
    s = "Python code"
    print s
```

    Using 4 spaces
    is like using
    3-backtick fences.
````

```plaintext
~~~
Tildes are OK too.
~~~
```

The three examples above render as:

```python
def function():
    #indenting works just fine in the fenced code block
    s = "Python code"
    print s
```

```plaintext
Using 4 spaces
is like using
3-backtick fences.
```

```plaintext
Tildes are OK too.
```

### Syntax highlighting

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#syntax-highlighting).

GitLab uses the [Rouge Ruby library](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge) for more colorful syntax
highlighting in code blocks. For a list of supported languages visit the
[Rouge project wiki](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge/wiki/List-of-supported-languages-and-lexers).
Syntax highlighting is supported only in code blocks, so you can't highlight inline code.

To fence and apply syntax highlighting to a block of code, append the code language
to the opening code declaration, three back-ticks (```` ``` ````) or three tildes (`~~~`):

````markdown
```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
def function():
    #indenting works just fine in the fenced code block
    s = "Python syntax highlighting"
    print s
```

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

```
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
s = "No highlighting is shown for this line."
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```
````

The four examples above render as:

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

```python
def function():
    #indenting works just fine in the fenced code block
    s = "Python syntax highlighting"
    print s
```

```ruby
require 'redcarpet'
markdown = Redcarpet.new("Hello World!")
puts markdown.to_html
```

```plaintext
No language indicated, so no syntax highlighting.
s = "No highlighting is shown for this line."
But let's throw in a <b>tag</b>.
```

## Diagrams and flowcharts

You can generate diagrams from text by using:

- [Mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/)
- [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com)
- [Kroki](https://kroki.io) to create a wide variety of diagrams.

In wikis, you can also add and edit diagrams created with the [diagrams.net editor](#diagramsnet-editor).

### Mermaid

> - Support for Entity Relationship diagrams and mind maps [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/384386) in GitLab 16.0.

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#mermaid).

Visit the [official page](https://mermaidjs.github.io/) for more details. The
[Mermaid Live Editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor/) helps you
learn Mermaid and debug issues in your Mermaid code. Use it to identify and resolve
issues in your diagrams.

To generate a diagram or flowchart, write your text inside the `mermaid` block:

````markdown
```mermaid
graph TD;
  A-->B;
  A-->C;
  B-->D;
  C-->D;
```
````

```mermaid
graph TD;
  A-->B;
  A-->C;
  B-->D;
  C-->D;
```

You can also include subgraphs:

````markdown
```mermaid
graph TB
  SubGraph1 --> SubGraph1Flow

  subgraph "SubGraph 1 Flow"
    SubGraph1Flow(SubNode 1)
    SubGraph1Flow -- Choice1 --> DoChoice1
    SubGraph1Flow -- Choice2 --> DoChoice2
  end

  subgraph "Main Graph"
    Node1[Node 1] --> Node2[Node 2]
    Node2 --> SubGraph1[Jump to SubGraph1]
    SubGraph1 --> FinalThing[Final Thing]
  end
```
````

```mermaid
graph TB
  SubGraph1 --> SubGraph1Flow

  subgraph "SubGraph 1 Flow"
    SubGraph1Flow(SubNode 1)
    SubGraph1Flow -- Choice1 --> DoChoice1
    SubGraph1Flow -- Choice2 --> DoChoice2
  end

  subgraph "Main Graph"
    Node1[Node 1] --> Node2[Node 2]
    Node2 --> SubGraph1[Jump to SubGraph1]
    SubGraph1 --> FinalThing[Final Thing]
  end
```

### PlantUML

PlantUML integration is enabled on GitLab.com. To make PlantUML available in GitLab Self-Managed
installation of GitLab, a GitLab administrator [must enable it](../administration/integration/plantuml.md).

After you enable PlantUML, diagram delimiters `@startuml`/`@enduml` aren't required, as these
are replaced by the `plantuml` block. For example:

````markdown
```plantuml
Bob -> Alice : hello
Alice -> Bob : hi
```
````

You can include or embed a PlantUML diagram from separate files in the repository using
the `::include` directive.
For more information, see [Include diagram files](../administration/integration/plantuml.md#include-diagram-files).

### Kroki

To make Kroki available in GitLab, a GitLab administrator must enable it.
For more information, see the [Kroki integration](../administration/integration/kroki.md) page.

## Math equations

> - LaTeX-compatible fencing [introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/21757) in GitLab 15.4 [with a flag](../administration/feature_flags.md) named `markdown_dollar_math`. Disabled by default. Enabled on GitLab.com.
> - LaTeX-compatible fencing [generally available](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/371180) in GitLab 15.8. Feature flag `markdown_dollar_math` removed.

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#math).

Math written in LaTeX syntax is rendered with [KaTeX](https://github.com/KaTeX/KaTeX).
_KaTeX only supports a [subset](https://katex.org/docs/supported.html) of LaTeX._
This syntax also works in AsciiDoc wikis and files using `:stem: latexmath`. For details, see
the [Asciidoctor user manual](https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/#activating-stem-support).

To prevent malicious activity, GitLab renders only the first 50 inline math instances.
You can disable this limit [for a group](../api/graphql/reference/_index.md#mutationgroupupdate)
or for the entire [GitLab Self-Managed instance](../administration/instance_limits.md#math-rendering-limits).

The number of math blocks is also limited based on render time. If the limit is exceeded,
GitLab renders the excess math instances as text. Wiki and repository files do not have
these limits.

Math written between dollar signs with backticks (``` $`...`$ ```) or single dollar signs (`$...$`)
is rendered inline with the text.

Math written between double dollar signs (`$$...$$`) or in a [code block](#code-spans-and-blocks) with
the language declared as `math` is rendered on a separate line:

`````markdown
This math is inline: $`a^2+b^2=c^2`$.

This math is on a separate line using a ```` ```math ```` block:

```math
a^2+b^2=c^2
```

This math is on a separate line using inline `$$`: $$a^2+b^2=c^2$$

This math is on a separate line using a `$$...$$` block:

$$
a^2+b^2=c^2
$$
`````

![Example of math in GitLab](img/markdown_math_v17_2.png)

## Table of contents

A table of contents is an unordered list that links to subheadings in the document.
You can add a table of contents to issues, merge requests, and epics, but you can't add one
to notes or comments.

Add one of these tags on their own line to the **description** field of any of the supported
content types:

<!--
Tags for the table of contents are presented in a code block to work around a Markdown bug.
Do not change the code block back to single backticks.
For more information, see https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/359077.
-->

```markdown
[[_TOC_]]
or
[TOC]
```

- Markdown files.
- Wiki pages.
- Issues.
- Merge requests.
- Epics.

NOTE:
A table of contents renders also when you use the TOC code in single square brackets, regardless of
being on its own line or not.
This behavior is unintended.
For more information, see [issue 359077](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/359077).

```markdown
This sentence introduces my wiki page.

[[_TOC_]]

## My first heading

First section content.

## My second heading

Second section content.
```

![Preview of an auto-generated table of contents in a Wiki](img/markdown_toc_preview_v12_9.png)

## Colors

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#colors).

Markdown does not support changing text color.

You can write a color code in the formats: `HEX`, `RGB`, or `HSL`.

- `HEX`: `` `#RGB[A]` `` or `` `#RRGGBB[AA]` ``
- `RGB`: `` `RGB[A](R, G, B[, A])` ``
- `HSL`: `` `HSL[A](H, S, L[, A])` ``

Named colors are not supported.

In the GitLab application (but not the GitLab documentation) color codes in backticks
display a color chip next to the color code. For example:

```markdown
- `#F00`
- `#F00A`
- `#FF0000`
- `#FF0000AA`
- `RGB(0,255,0)`
- `RGB(0%,100%,0%)`
- `RGBA(0,255,0,0.3)`
- `HSL(540,70%,50%)`
- `HSLA(540,70%,50%,0.3)`
```

- `#F00`
- `#F00A`
- `#FF0000`
- `#FF0000AA`
- `RGB(0,255,0)`
- `RGB(0%,100%,0%)`
- `RGBA(0,255,0,0.3)`
- `HSL(540,70%,50%)`
- `HSLA(540,70%,50%,0.3)`

### Emoji and your operating system

The previous emoji example uses hard-coded images. Rendered emoji
in GitLab might look different depending on the OS and browser used.

Most emoji are natively supported on macOS, Windows, iOS, Android, and fall back on image-based
emoji where there is no support.

<!-- vale gitlab_base.Spelling = NO -->

On Linux, you can download [Noto Color Emoji](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji)
to get full native emoji support. Ubuntu 22.04 (like many modern Linux distributions) has
this font installed by default.

<!-- vale gitlab_base.Spelling = YES -->

To learn more about adding custom emoji, see [Custom emoji](emoji_reactions.md#custom-emoji).

## Front matter

Front matter is metadata included at the beginning of a Markdown document, preceding
the content. This data can be used by static site generators like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/),
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/), and many other applications.

When you view a Markdown file rendered by GitLab, front matter is displayed as-is,
in a box at the top of the document. The HTML content displays after the front matter. To view an example,
you can toggle between the source and rendered version of a
[GitLab documentation file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/index.md).

In GitLab, front matter is used only in Markdown files and wiki pages, not the other
places where Markdown formatting is supported. It must be at the very top of the document
and must be between delimiters.

The following delimiters are supported:

- YAML (`---`):

  ```yaml
  ---
  title: About Front Matter
  example:
    language: yaml
  ---
  ```

- TOML (`+++`):

  ```toml
  +++
  title = "About Front Matter"
  [example]
  language = "toml"
  +++
  ```

- JSON (`;;;`):

  ```json
  ;;;
  {
    "title": "About Front Matter"
    "example": {
      "language": "json"
    }
  }
  ;;;
  ```

Other languages are supported by adding a specifier to any of the existing
delimiters. For example:

```php
---php
$title = "About Front Matter";
$example = array(
  'language' => "php",
);
---
```

## Includes

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/195798) in GitLab 17.7.

Use includes, or include directives, to add the content of a document inside another document.

For example, a book could be split into multiple chapters, and then each chapter could be included in
the main book document:

```markdown
::include{file=chapter1.md}

::include{file=chapter2.md}
```

In GitLab, include directives are used only in Markdown files and wiki pages, not the other
places where Markdown formatting is supported.

Use an include directive in a Markdown file:

```markdown
::include{file=example_file.md}
```

Use an include directive in a wiki page:

```markdown
::include{file=example_page.md}
```

Each `::include` must start at the beginning of a line, and specifies a file or URL for `file=`.
The content of the specified file (or URL) is included at the position of the `::include` and
processed with the remaining Markdown.

Include directives inside the included file are ignored.
For example, if `file1` includes `file2`, and `file2` includes `file3`, when `file1` is processed,
it doesn't have the contents of `file3`.

### Include limits

To guarantee good system performance and prevent malicious documents from causing problems, GitLab
enforces a maximum limit on the number of include directives processed in a document.
By default, a document can have up to 32 include directives.

To customize the number of processed include directives, administrators can change the
`asciidoc_max_includes` application setting with the
[application settings API](../api/settings.md#available-settings).

### Use includes from external URLs

To use includes from separate wiki pages or external URLs, administrators can enable the
`wiki_asciidoc_allow_uri_includes`
[application setting](../administration/wikis/_index.md#allow-uri-includes-for-asciidoc).

```markdown
<!-- define application setting wiki_asciidoc_allow_uri_includes to true to allow content to be read from URI -->
::include{file=https://example.org/installation.md}
```

### Use includes in code blocks

You can use the `::include` directive inside code blocks to add content from files in your repository.
For example, if your repository contains a file `javascript_code.js`:

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

You can include it in your Markdown file:

````markdown
Our script contains:

```javascript
::include{file=javascript_code.js}
```
````

The content renders as:

Our script contains:

```javascript
var s = "JavaScript syntax highlighting";
alert(s);
```

## Escape characters

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#escape-characters).

Markdown reserves the following ASCII characters to format the page:

```plaintext
! " # $ % & ' ( ) * + , - . / : ; < = > ? @ [ \ ] ^ _ ` { | } ~
```

To use one of these reserved characters in your text, add the backslash character (` \ `) immediately before the
reserved character. When you place the backslash before a reserved character, the Markdown parser omits the
backslash and treats the reserved character as regular text.

Examples:

```plaintext
\# Not a heading

| Food            | Do you like this food? (circle) |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|
|  Pizza          |  Yes \| No                      |


\**Not bold, just italic text placed between some asterisks*\*
```

When rendered, the escaped characters look like this:

---

\# Not a heading

| Food            | Do you like this food? (circle)|
|-----------------|--------------------------------|
|  Pizza          |  Yes \| No                     |

\**Not bold, just italic text placed between some asterisks*\*

---

Exceptions:

A backslash doesn't always escape the character that follows it. The backslash appears as regular text in the following cases:

- When the backslash appears before a non-reserved character, such as `A`, `3`, or a space.
- When the backslash appears inside of these Markdown elements:
  - Code blocks
  - Code spans
  - Auto-links
  - Inline HTML, such as `<kbd>`

In these instances you might need to use the equivalent HTML entity, such as `&#93;` for `]`.

## Footnotes

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#footnotes).

Footnotes add a link to a note rendered at the end of a Markdown file.

To make a footnote, you need both a reference tag and a separate line (anywhere in the file) with
the note content.

Regardless of the tag names, the relative order of the reference tags determines the rendered
numbering.

Regardless where you put the note, it's always shown at the bottom of the file.

<!--
The following codeblock uses HTML to skip the Vale ReferenceLinks test.
Do not change it back to a markdown codeblock.
-->

<pre class="highlight"><code>A footnote reference tag looks like this: [^1]

This reference tag is a mix of letters and numbers. [^footnote-42]

&#91;^1]: This text is inside a footnote.

&#91;^footnote-42]: This text is another footnote.
</code></pre>

A footnote reference tag looks like this:[^1]

This reference tag is a mix of letters and numbers.[^footnote-42]

<!--
Do not delete the single space before the [^1] and [^footnotes] references below.
These are used to force the Vale ReferenceLinks check to skip these examples.
-->

 [^1]: This text is inside a footnote.

 [^footnote-42]: This text is another footnote.

## Inline HTML

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown, and it usually works pretty well.

See the documentation for `HTML::Pipeline`'s [SanitizationFilter](https://github.com/gjtorikian/html-pipeline/blob/v2.12.3/lib/html/pipeline/sanitization_filter.rb#L42)
class for the list of allowed HTML tags and attributes. In addition to the default
`SanitizationFilter` allowlist, GitLab allows `span`, `abbr`, `details` and `summary` elements.
`rel="license"` is allowed on links to support the [Rel-License microformat](https://microformats.org/wiki/rel-license) and license attribution.

It's still possible to use Markdown inside HTML tags, but only if the lines containing Markdown
are separated into their own lines:

```html
<dl>
  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. HTML tags work, in most cases.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML with proper spacing</dt>
  <dd>

  Does *not* work **very** well. HTML tags work, in most cases.

  </dd>
</dl>
```

<!--

Markdown is fine in GitLab.

<dl>
  <dt>Markdown in HTML</dt>
  <dd>Does *not* work **very** well. HTML tags work, in most cases.</dd>

  <dt>Markdown in HTML with proper spacing</dt>
  <dd>

  Does <em>not</em> work <b>very</b> well. HTML tags work, in most cases.

  </dd>
</dl>

### Collapsible section

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#details-and-summary).

Content can be collapsed using HTML's [`<details>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details)
and [`<summary>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary)
tags. For example, collapse a long log file so it takes up less screen space.

```html
<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

These details <em>remain</em> <strong>hidden</strong> until expanded.

<pre><code>PASTE LOGS HERE</code></pre>

</details>
```

<details>
<summary>Click to expand</summary>

These details <em>remain</em> <strong>hidden</strong> until expanded.

<pre><code>PASTE LOGS HERE</code></pre>

</details>

---

Markdown inside these tags is also supported.

Remember to leave a blank line before and after any Markdown sections, as shown in the example:

````html
<details>
<summary>

Click to _expand._

</summary>

These details _remain_ **hidden** until expanded.

```
PASTE LOGS HERE
```

</details>
````

<!--
The example below uses HTML to force correct rendering on docs.gitlab.com, Markdown
works correctly in GitLab.
-->

<details>
<summary>Click to <em>expand.</em></summary>

These details <em>remain</em> <b>hidden</b> until expanded.

<pre><code>PASTE LOGS HERE</code></pre>

</details>

### Keyboard HTML tag

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#keyboard-html-tag).

The `<kbd>` element is used to identify text that represents user keyboard input. Text surrounded by `<kbd>` tags is typically displayed in the browser's default monospace font.

```html
Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to go to the next page.
```

Press <kbd>Enter</kbd> to go to the next page.

### Superscripts and subscripts

[View this topic rendered in GitLab](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/doc/user/markdown.md#superscripts-subscripts).

For superscripts and subscripts, use the standard HTML syntax:

```html
The formula for water is H<sub>2</sub>O
while the equation for the theory of relativity is E = mc<sup>2</sup>.
```

<!-- vale gitlab_base.Spelling = NO -->

The formula for water is H<sub>2</sub>O
while the equation for the theory of relativity is E = mc<sup>2</sup>.

<!-- vale gitlab_base.Spelling = YES -->

GitLab Flavored Markdown doesn't support the Redcarpet superscript syntax ( `x^2` ).

## Wiki-specific Markdown

The following topics show how links inside wikis behave.

When linking to wiki pages, you should use the **page slug** rather than the page name.

### Direct page link

A direct page link includes the slug for a page that points to that page,
at the base level of the wiki.

This example links to a `documentation` page at the root of your wiki:

```markdown
[Link to Documentation](documentation)
```

### Direct file link

A direct file link points to a file extension for a file, relative to the current page.

If the following example is on a page at `<your_wiki>/documentation/related`,
it links to `<your_wiki>/documentation/file.md`:

```markdown
[Link to File](file.md)
```

### Hierarchical link

A hierarchical link can be constructed relative to the current wiki page by using relative paths like `./<page>` or
`../<page>`.

If this example is on a page at `<your_wiki>/documentation/main`,
it links to `<your_wiki>/documentation/related`:

```markdown
[Link to Related Page](related)
```

If this example is on a page at `<your_wiki>/documentation/related/content`,
it links to `<your_wiki>/documentation/main`:

```markdown
[Link to Related Page](../main)
```

If this example is on a page at `<your_wiki>/documentation/main`,
it links to `<your_wiki>/documentation/related.md`:

```markdown
[Link to Related Page](related.md)
```

If this example is on a page at `<your_wiki>/documentation/related/content`,
it links to `<your_wiki>/documentation/main.md`:

```markdown
[Link to Related Page](../main.md)
```

### Root link

A root link starts with a `/` and is relative to the wiki root.

This example links to `<wiki_root>/documentation`:

```markdown
[Link to Related Page](/documentation)
```

This example links to `<wiki_root>/documentation.md`:

```markdown
[Link to Related Page](/documentation.md)
```

### diagrams.net editor

> - [Introduced](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/322174) in GitLab 15.10.

In wikis, you can use the [diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) editor to create diagrams. You
can also edit diagrams created with the diagrams.net editor. The diagram editor is available in both
the plain text editor and the rich text editor.

For more information, see [Diagrams.net](../administration/integration/diagrams_net.md).

#### Plain text editor

To create a diagram in the plain text editor:

1. On the wiki page you want to edit, select **Edit**.
1. In the text box, make sure you're using the plain text editor
   (the button on the bottom left says **Switch to rich text editing**).
1. In the editor's toolbar, select **Insert or edit diagram** (**{diagram}**).
1. Create the diagram in the [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) editor.
1. Select **Save & exit**.

A Markdown image reference to the diagram is inserted in the wiki content.

To edit a diagram in the plain text editor:

1. On the wiki page you want to edit, select **Edit**.
1. In the text box, make sure you're using the plain text editor
   (the button on the bottom left says **Switch to rich text editing**).
1. Position your cursor in the Markdown image reference that contains the diagram.
1. Select **Insert or edit diagram** (**{diagram}**).
1. Edit the diagram in the [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) editor.
1. Select **Save & exit**.

A Markdown image reference to the diagram is inserted in the wiki content,
replacing the previous diagram.

#### Rich text editor

To create a diagram in the rich text editor:

1. On the wiki page you want to edit, select **Edit**.
1. In the text box, make sure you're using the rich text editor
   (the button on the bottom left says **Switch to plain text editing**).
1. In the editor's toolbar, select **More options** (**{plus}**).
1. In the dropdown list, select **Create or edit diagram**.
1. Create the diagram in the [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) editor.
1. Select **Save & exit**.

The diagram as visualized in the diagrams.net editor is inserted in the wiki content.

To edit a diagram in the rich text editor:

1. On the wiki page you want to edit, select **Edit**.
1. In the text box, make sure you're using the rich text editor
   (the button on the bottom left says **Switch to plain text editing**).
1. Select the diagram that you want to edit.
1. In the floating toolbar, select **Edit diagram** (**{diagram}**).
1. Edit the diagram in the [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) editor.
1. Select **Save & exit**.

The selected diagram is replaced with an updated version.
